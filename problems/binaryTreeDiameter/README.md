Stumped by this. There's a brute force solution, but GPT suggest its N complexity. I have no idea.

I was thinking if you convert left, right to x, y you could make some sort of graph.

Root 0,0
2: 1, 0
3: 0, 1
4: 2, 0
5: 2, 1

Nope. What about negatives?

Root 0,0
2: -1
3: 1
4: -2
5: -1

1: 0, 0
2: 0, 1
3: -1, 1
4: 0, 2
5: -2, 1


2, 1

n (to traverse)

n ( )

I'm clearly tired. This doesn't make sense.
