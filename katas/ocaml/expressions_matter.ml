(* Given three integers a, b, and c, return the largest number obtained after inserting the operators +, *, and parentheses (). In other words, try every combination of a, b, and c with the operators, without reordering the operands, and return the maximum value. *)
(**)
(* Example *)
(* With the numbers 1, 2, and 3, here are some possible expressions: *)
(**)
(* 1 * (2 + 3) = 5 *)
(* 1 * 2 * 3 = 6 *)
(* 1 + 2 * 3 = 7 *)
(* (1 + 2) * 3 = 9 *)
(* The maximum value that can be obtained is 9. *)
(**)
(* Notes *)
(* The numbers are always positive, in the range 1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10. *)
(* You can use the same operation more than once. *)
(* It is not necessary to use all the operators or parentheses. *)
(* You cannot swap the operands. For example, with the given numbers, you cannot get the expression (1 + 3) * 2 = 8. *)
(* Input and Output Examples *)
(* expressionsMatter(1, 2, 3) ==> 9, because (1 + 2) * 3 = 9. *)
(* expressionsMatter(1, 1, 1) ==> 3, because 1 + 1 + 1 = 3. *)
(* expressionsMatter(9, 1, 1) ==> 18, because 9 * (1 + 1) = 18. *)
